# Technical Assessment Repository

Welcome! We're excited that you're considering joining our engineering team at Tarrina Health. This repository contains some technical challenges designed to showcase your skills in a comfortable, pressure-free environment.

## Our Assessment Philosophy

Traditional 1-v-1 interviews can be nerve-wracking and don't always reflect real-world development scenarios. We believe in giving candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities in familiar surroundings, using their preferred tools and taking the time they need to produce quality work.

Our assessments mirror the technologies and problem-solving approaches you'll encounter in your day-to-day work at Tarrina Health, helping us understand how you think through challenges and implement solutions.

## Time Investment

We respect that you have a full life outside of job applications. These assessments are designed to be completed in approximately 3-4 hours, though you're welcome to invest more or less time based on your schedule and preferences.

When submitting your work, please let us know roughly how much time you spent. This helps us calibrate our expectations and better understand your process. If you'd like to outline additional features or improvements you would have implemented with more time, we'd love to hear about those ideas too. Even describing unimplemented tests or architectural decisions provides valuable insight into your thinking.

## Collaboration and Resources

We understand that real-world development often involves researching existing solutions and adapting them to your needs. If you reference external code, tutorials, or solutions during your assessment, please document these sources. We're interested in seeing how you evaluate, modify, and integrate external resources rather than expecting everything to be built from scratch.

The goal is authentic representation of your problem-solving approach, whether that involves independent implementation or thoughtful adaptation of existing solutions.

## How to Proceed

1. Browse the available assessments below and select one that aligns with your target role
2. Review the requirements and technical specifications thoroughly
3. Build your solution with attention to code quality and best practices
4. Document your approach, assumptions, and any trade-offs you made
5. Share with us your deliverables in any modality: You can put the deliverables on Github / Google Drive / Email, etc. 

## Questions and Support

If anything is unclear or you need clarification on requirements, please reach out. We want you to succeed and are happy to provide guidance.

Best of luck with your assessment!
